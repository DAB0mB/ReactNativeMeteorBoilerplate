# React Native Meteor Boilerplate

This is a React Native app which uses Meteor as its backend. It should be used as a sample boilerplate for starting a new app of your own.

### Quick Start

Install all the dependencies:

    $ npm install

Bundle Meteor client:

    $ npm run meteor-bundle-client

Start the API server:

    $ npm run api

Run the app:

    $ npm start

> **Note:** The API URL is configured to `http://localhost:3000` by default. If you would like to change that, be sure to visit the official `README.md` file of [Meteor Client Bundler](https://github.com/Urigo/meteor-client-bundler) for detailed instructions.
